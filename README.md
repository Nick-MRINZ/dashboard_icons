This external module will swap the form completion status icons on the record status dashboard to a set chosen from Font Awesome. 
This was designed to make the dashboard easier to use for colourblind users but can be used by anyone. 

The module will switch the form completion icons on the following pages:
- record_status_dashboard.php
- record_home.php
As well as any form completion icons that appear in the left hand sidebar when a user is in a form. 

This functionality can be activated for all users on the system or specific set. 
If you only want to activate it for specific users then you need to input their account username into the repeating "Activate for a Specific User" configuration field.
